# 🕹️ SmashCore: Training Arc

Welcome to **SmashCore**, a collection of Verilog labs I completed as part of my Computer Architecture course. Each lab represents a stage in my journey—like leveling up a character in *Super Smash Bros*. These projects helped me sharpen my skills in digital design, from basic gates to building a functional CPU datapath.

## 🎮 Project Overview

This repository contains multiple labs designed to build up proficiency in:

- Combinational and sequential logic
- Finite State Machines (FSMs)
- ALU and datapath design
- Memory interfacing
- Control logic and pipelining

Think of each lab like a different training stage—each one tested and leveled up my Verilog knowledge.

## 🧩 Labs Included

| Lab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `Lab1.zip` | 🎓 Introduction to basic logic gates and Verilog syntax |
| `Lab2CA_1.zip` / `lab2CA_part2.zip` | ⚙️ Adders, multiplexers, and fundamental combinational circuits |
| `Lab_3CA.zip` | 🔄 Finite State Machine (FSM) design and simulation |
| `lab_4CA.zip` | 💥 Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) implementation |
| `lab5_CA.zip` | 🏃 Integrating control logic with a datapath |
| `lab6_CA.zip` | 🧠 Register files and memory control |
| `lab8_CA.zip` | 🧩 Instruction decoding and control signal generation |
| `lab9_CA.zip` | ⛓️ Basic pipelining and hazard detection |
| `lab10_CA.zip` | 💣 Complete CPU datapath integration |

## 🛠️ Tools Used

All labs were developed and tested using:

- **Vivado** (by Xilinx) for simulation, synthesis, and analysis

## 📂 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the specific lab ZIP files.
2. Extract the files and open the project in Vivado.
3. Run simulations using the provided testbenches (`tb_*.v`).
4. View waveforms and debug using Vivado’s built-in tools.

Each lab is modular and well-commented for readability and reuse.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

Designing with Verilog is like mastering a main in Smash—timing, control, and precision matter. From fighting through FSM logic to debugging pipeline stalls, each lab taught me something new about how computers tick.

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

This repo is more than homework—it's a highlight reel of my training arc in Computer Architecture. Whether you’re a fellow student, a recruiter, or just here to learn, feel free to explore and power up your HDL game.

**Game on.**
